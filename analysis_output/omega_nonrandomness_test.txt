Non-randomness test for Ω (language-level)
=========================================

We compute one robust summary per language: median Ω over sentences.
We then test whether the median of these language medians is > 0.

Number of languages (L): 21
Languages with median Ω > 0: 21
Languages with median Ω = 0: 0
Languages with median Ω < 0: 0

Median of language medians: 0.4282
Bootstrap 95% CI (median): [0.4032, 0.4499]

Exact one-sided sign test (discarding ties at 0)
Effective sample size (non-ties): 21
Positive non-ties: 21
p-value (H1: median > 0): 4.768e-07
